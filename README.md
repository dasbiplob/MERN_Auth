# MERN_Auth
This is a starter app for a MERN stack application with authentication. This is for a SPA (Single Page Application) workflow that uses the Vite Build tool. This authentication workflow is based off of my MERN Stack From Scratch | eCommerce course.

It includes the following:

Backend API with Express & MongoDB
Routes for auth, logout, register, profile, update profile
JWT authentication stored in HTTP-only cookie
Protected routes and endpoints
Custom middleware to check JSON web token and store in cookie
Custom error middleware
React frontend to register, login, logout, view profile, and update profile
React Bootstrap UI library
React Toastify notifications

# RUN

# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
npm run dev

# Run backend only
npm run server
